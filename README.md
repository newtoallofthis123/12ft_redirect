# 12ft Redirect

12ft.io is a popular website for unlocking paywalled articles. It is a great service and I use it a lot. But, I am lazy and I don't like typing the whole URL. So, I made this chrome extension to redirect me to the 12ft ladder.

It is open source and you can find the source code on  GitHub You can actually just check it out. It is written in just 20 lines of code. Yep. That's it. 20 lines of code.

## Installation

1. Download the CRX file from the [releases](https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/12ft_redirect/releases) page.

2. Open the extensions page in chrome. You can do this by typing `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.

3. Drag and drop the CRX file into the extensions page.

4. Click on `Add extension` in the popup.

5. Done! Now, open any paywalled article, click on the extension icon and you will be redirected to the 12ft ladder.
